Every platform — from YouTube to e-commerce to social media influencer — deals with thousands of comments daily.  
Manual moderation is impossible, and unfiltered toxic content damages user trust.  

**InsightComment** was built to:  
-  Automatically classify feedback (positive/negative/neutral)  
- Detect toxic or spam content before it spreads  
- Provide insights that help improve user experience  

This project is designed to show how **AI + web tech** can make moderation smarter and faster.
